* Problem
Attempting to find a nice way to backup, version, and use my emacs state.

Doom attempts to do this with immutable infrastructure. Only store configs. Build out the install from the state.
This is reasonable, but there is still some need to store the actual STATE. Config can be broken or get weird.
Also I want to be able to migrate off of doom sometimes.

I might like to flip between multiple versions of emacs-core-install, or between doom, spacemacs, or some custom version.

Emacs always wants to find it's install at =~/.emacs.d=.
So the solution is symlinking this known path with some backed-up paths.

* Symlinking Configs
Following the idea presented here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21568966

This directory should hold my doom config and installation(s) of emacs.

Symlink to select which one I want to use.

eg
: ln -s /home/josh/emacs_configs/doom /home/josh/.doom.d
: ln -s /home/josh/emacs_configs/28.1/.emacs.d /home/josh/.emacs.d
