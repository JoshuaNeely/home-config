#+title: Readme

Stow is used to sync the contents of this directory with the $HOME dir using symlinks.

This command is used to build symlinks.
: stow --verbose --dotfiles --dir $HOME/stow --target $HOME .

A .stowrc is included in this syncing. This more simple command should be possible after .stowrc is in place.
: stow .
